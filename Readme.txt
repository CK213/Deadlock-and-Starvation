You can run the program by typing "java c3291914A2". 
As I input all four programs in a single file.
For this program I coded with Java, and there will be a content list once you start running the program.

You can type the number to it's responding task.
Then type the file directory.


The system will keep on running and allow you to do all three tasks, until you input 4, which is exit program, then the whole program will stop and exit.
