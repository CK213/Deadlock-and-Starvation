COMP2240 Assignment2

This program divided into 3 sections: 
1) Sharing the bridge, the bridge can become deadlock if both farmers are on the bridge, semaphores is used to prevent deadlock, threads is used to simulate multiple farmers and assume that the stream of farmers are constantly attempting to use the bridge from either direction.
2) Ice-cream time, semaphores is used to design and implement an algorithm that manages the customers entering and leaving the ice-cream parlour in line with manager's rules. Use threads to simulate multiple customers. The program for this section is starvation free. Assume no time is wated in taking seat, serving/ starting eating ice-cream and leavinf the parlour.
3) Hot or Iced Coffee, monitor is used to design and implement an algorithm that ensures the operation of the coffee machine according to the above characteristics. Using threads to simulate clients.

You can run the program by typing "java c3291914A2". 
As I input all four programs in a single file.
For this program I coded with Java, and there will be a content list once you start running the program.

You can type the number to it's responding task.
Then type the file directory.

The system will keep on running and allow you to do all three tasks, until you input 4, which is exit program, then the whole program will stop and exit.
